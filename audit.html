                it have sound and

            <td id="decent">Kahoot is an amazingly 
                engaging game where students
                or friends have to quickly
                answer questions and who 
                ever performs the best takes 
                first place on the leaderboard.
                The music changes with each
                new question asked creating
                a feeling of tension and when
                the question is finished it goes
                to a relaxing fade out which
                heavily grabs the users 
                attention. The challenge 
                depends on the category of
                questions being asked and 
                the reward you get is being 
                above all your other mates

                on kahoot, it improves heavily
                in engagement. This app has
                multiple game modes with a live
                tracker for where you are in the
                leaderboard, there are no 
                pauses, there is no music change
                it is just you, versus your class
                mates, you have to keep 
                answering questions before the
                time runs out and whoever 
                collects the most coins or goes 
                the farthest (depending on the 
                game mode) wins at the end.
                It is extremely visually appealing
                with very fluid animations and
                powerups. There is a very good
                balance of challenge and reward
                and a lot of luck is also present.

                a note correct and when you
                make a mistake, there is 
                music which plays in the menu
                and then a song plays which
                you will learn before the lesson
                starts. It offers a very good
                balance between challenge
                and reward and the challenge
                increases further if you pick a
